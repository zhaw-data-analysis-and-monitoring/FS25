## Data types

### Doubles

There are two different `numeric` data types in R:

- `double`: floating-point number (e.g. 10.3, 7.3)
- `integer` (e.g. 10, 7)


A double / floating point number is assigned to a variable as follows:

```{r}
x <- 10.3

x

class(x)
```

:::{.callout-note}

Either `<-` or `=` can be used. However, the latter is also easily confused with `==`.

```{r}
y = 7.3
y
```


:::

### Integer

A number is only stored as an `integer` if it is explicitly defined as one (using `as.integer()` or `L`).

```{r}
d <- 8L

class(d)
```



### Boolean

```{r}
sunny <- FALSE
dry <- TRUE

sunny & dry
```

```{r}
e <- 3
f <- 6

e > f
```

### Character

**Character** strings contain text.

```{r}
fname <- "Andrea"
lname <- "Muster"
class(fname)
```

Connecting / concatenating character strings

```{r}
paste(fname, lname)
paste(fname, lname, sep = ",")
```

### Factors

Factors in R denote a collection of repeating character strings, e.g. the policical parties represented in the federal council ("Bundesrat").

```{r}

# with c(), we can combine multiple character strings
# we will learn about this later
bundesrat <- c("die Mitte","FDP", "SVP", "FDP", "SVP", "SP", "SP")

class(bundesrat)

bundesrat2 <- as.factor(bundesrat)

bundesrat2
```

By default, the factor levels are ordered alphabetically. Sometimes we may want to order the factors, usually for visualisation purposes. To do so, we specify the `levels` in the order we want and set `ordered = TRUE`.

```{r}
factor(bundesrat, levels = c("SP", "die Mitte", "FDP", "SVP"), ordered = TRUE)
```

### Date / time

```{r}
#| echo: false
now_txt <- as.POSIXct("2024-02-01 13:45:00")

now_pretty <- strftime(now_txt, format = "%d.%m.%Y at %H:%M")
n_secs <- as.numeric(now_txt)
n_secs_pretty <- format(n_secs,big.mark = "'")
```

R requires date / time data types to be stored in the `POSIXct` format. Internally, `POSIXct` is a numeric value, counting the number of seconds since midnight of January 1st, 1970 (which is also called *unix epoch*). On `{r} now_pretty`, `{r} n_secs_pretty` have passed since the *unix epoch*, so to store this timestamp, R stores the number `{r} n_secs_pretty`.




```{r}
# We may have a timestamp saved as a character string
today_txt <- "2024-02-01 13:45:00"

# as.POSIXct converts the string to POSIXct:
today_posixct <- as.POSIXct(today_txt)

# When printing a posixct date to the console, it is human readable
today_posixct

# To see the internally stored value (# of seconds), convert it to numeric:
as.numeric(today_posixct)

```

If the character string is delivered in the above format (`year-month-day hour:minute:second`), *as.POSIXct* knows how to caluate the number of seconds since *unix epoch*. However, if the format is different, we have to tell R how to read our timestamp. This requires a special syntax, which is described in `?strptime`.

```{r}
#| error: true
date_txt <- "01.10.2017 15:15"

# converts character to POSIXct:
as.POSIXct(date_txt)

date_posix <- as.POSIXct(date_txt, format = "%d.%m.%Y %H:%M")

date_posix
```


Theoretically, `strftime` can also be used to extract specific components from a date. However, the functions from `lubridate` are much simpler and we recommend you use these. Note how `strftime` always returns strings while `lubridate` returns more useful datatypes such as integers or factors.

```{r}
#| collapse: true

strftime(date_posix, format = "%m")           # <1>
strftime(date_posix, format = "%b")           # <2>
strftime(date_posix, format = "%B")           # <3>
```
1. extracts the month as a number
2. extracts the month by name (abbreviated)
3. extracts the month by name (full)


```{r}
#| collapse: true

library("lubridate")

month(date_posix)                             # <1>
month(date_posix, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)  # <2>
month(date_posix, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE) # <3>
```
1. extracts the month as a number
2. extracts the month by name (abbreviated)
3. extracts the month by name (full)

## Time is hard

Handling date / time [is tricky](https://youtu.be/-5wpm-gesOY?si). We recommend the following practices to make life easier:

- Always store time as *POSIXct*, not as text.
- Always store *time* together with its according date, never separately.
- If you must extract time (e.g. to analyse daily patterns), store it as [decimal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time) (e.g. store `15:45` as `15.75`) in a numeric data type.
- Try to be explicit about which timezone your data originates from
- If your observation period is affected by switching to or from [daylight saving time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time), think about converting time to *UTC*
- Use `lubridate` rather than `strftime()`

## Data structures

### Vectors

Using `c()`, a set of values of the same data type can be assigned to a variable (as a *vector*).

```{r}
vec <- c(10, 20, 33, 42, 54, 66, 77)
vec

# to extract the 5th element
vec[5]

# to extract elements 2 to 4
vec[2:4]
```

### Lists

A `list` is a collection of objects that do not need to be the same data type.

```{r}
mylist <- list("q", TRUE, 3.14)
```

The individual elements in a list can also have assigned names.

```{r}
mylist2 <- list(fav_letter = "q", fav_boolean = TRUE, fav_number = 3.14)

mylist2
```

### Data frames 

If each entry in a list is the same length, this list can also be represented as a table, which is called a dataframe in R.

```{r}
# note how the names become column names
as.data.frame(mylist2)
```

The `data.frame` function allows a table to be created without first having to create a list.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  City = c("Zurich", "Geneva", "Basel", "Bern", "Lausanne"),
  Arrival = c(
    "1.1.2017 10:10", "5.1.2017 14:45",
    "8.1.2017 13:15", "17.1.2017 18:30", "22.1.2017 21:05"
  )
)

str(df)
```

The `$` symbol can be used to query data:

```{r}
df$City
```

New columns can be added and existing ones can be changed:

```{r}
df$Residents <- c(400000, 200000, 175000, 14000, 130000)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| purl: false

dplyr::tibble(df) 
```

We need to convert the Arrival time to a time format (`POSIXct`).

```{r}
# first, test the output of the "as.POSIXct"-function
as.POSIXct(df$Arrival, format = "%d.%m.%Y %H:%M")

# if it works, we can save the output to a new column
df$Arrival_ct <- as.POSIXct(df$Arrival, format = "%d.%m.%Y %H:%M")


# We *could* overwrite the old column, but this is a destructive operation!
```



These columns can now help to create **convenience variables**. E.g., the arrival time can be derived from the `Arrival` column.

```{r}
df$Arrival_day <- wday(df$Arrival_ct, label = TRUE, week_start = 1)

df$Arrival_day
```


```{r}
#| purl: false
#| echo: false
#| output: false
