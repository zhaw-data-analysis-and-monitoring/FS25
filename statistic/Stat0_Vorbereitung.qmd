## Preparation {#sec-stat-preparation}

As part of Statistic 1 - 3, we will need some R packages. We recommend installing them *before* the first lesson. Similar to the preparation exercise [in Prepro1](#sec-prepro-preparation) you can use the code below to automatically install all packages that have not yet been installed.

```{r}
#| eval: false

ipak <- function(pkg) {
  new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
  if (length(new.pkg)) {
    install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
  }
}

packages <- c('dplyr', 'wooldridge')

ipak(packages)
```
