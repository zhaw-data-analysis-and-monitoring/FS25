## Preparation {#sec-spatan-preparation}

As part of SpatAn 1 - 3, we will need some R packages. We recommend installing them *before* the first lesson. Similar to the preparation exercise [in InfoVis1](#sec-infovis-preparation) you can use `pacman` to automatically install all packages that have not yet been installed.

```{r}
pacman::p_install(
  "sf", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "spatstat.geom", 
  "spatstat.explore","spatstat.geom",
  "gstat", "tidyr", "terra", "tmap",
  force = FALSE,
  character.only = TRUE
  )
```

You can download the datasets for the exercises from Moodle.
